          <h2 id="einleitung-ueberblick" class="adsimple-312701248">Introduction and overview</h2>
          <p>We have written this data protection declaration (version 01/12/2024-312701248) to provide you with the
            requirements of <a class="adsimple-312701248"
              href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content /DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=312701248#d1e2269-1-1"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> and applicable
            national laws to explain which personal data (in short data) we as controllers &#8211; and the processors
            commissioned by us (e.g. providers) &#8211; process, will process in the future and what legal options you
            have. The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral.<br />
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">In short:</strong> We will inform you comprehensively about the data we
            process about you.
          </p>
          <p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terms. This data protection declaration,
            however, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible.
            To the extent that it promotes transparency, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner,
            links to further information are provided and graphics are used brought. We thereby inform you in clear and
            simple language that we only process personal data as part of our business activities if there is a
            corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible if you make as brief, unclear and legal-technical
            statements as possible, as are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you
            find the following explanations interesting and informative and perhaps there is one or two pieces of
            information that you didn't know before.<br />
            If you still have questions, we would like to ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the
            legal notice, follow the existing links and look at further information on third-party sites. You can of
            course also find our contact details in the legal notice.</p>
          <h2 id="application scope" class="adsimple-312701248">Application scope</h2>
          <p>This data protection declaration applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all
            personal data that companies commissioned by us (processors) process. By personal data we mean information
            within the meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR such as a person's name, email address and postal address. The
            processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and bill our services and products, whether online or
            offline. The scope of this data protection declaration includes:</p>
          <ul class="adsimple-312701248">
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Social media presence and email communication</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">In short:</strong> The data protection declaration applies to all areas
            in which personal data is processed in a structured manner within the company via the channels mentioned. If
            we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if
            necessary.
          </p>
          <h2 id="legal basis" class="adsimple-312701248">Legal basis</h2>
          <p>In the following data protection declaration we provide you with transparent information about the legal
            principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us
            to process personal data.<br />
            As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE
            COUNCIL of April 27, 2016. You can of course access this EU General Data Protection Regulation online on
            EUR-Lex, the access to the EU -Law, under <a class="adsimple-312701248"
              href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">https://eur-
              lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679</a> read it.</p>
          <p>We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">
              <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Consent</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us
              your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be saving the data you entered in a
              contact formars.
            </li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">
              <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Contract</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR): In order to
              fulfill a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data. For example, if we
              conclude a purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.
            </li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">
              <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we
              are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to keep
              invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.
            </li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">
              <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In
              the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to
              process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to operate our website
              securely and economically efficiently. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Other conditions such as the perception of recordings in the public interest and the exercise of public
            authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not generally apply to us. If such a legal basis
            is relevant, it will be shown in the appropriate place.</p>
          <p>In addition to the EU regulation, national laws also apply:</p>
          <ul class="adsimple-312701248">
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">In <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Austria</strong> this is the Federal
              Law on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (<strong

          <h2 id="storage duration" class="adsimple-312701248">Storage duration</h2>
          <p>It is a general criterion for us that we only store personal data for as long as it is absolutely necessary
            to provide our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for data
            processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the
            original purpose has ceased, for example for accounting purposes.</p>
          <p>If you wish to have your data deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted
            as quickly as possible and provided there is no obligation to store it.</p>
          <p>We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing, provided we have
            further information.</p>

          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What are cookies?</h3>
          <p>Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
            Below we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following data
            protection declaration.</p>
          <p>Whenever you surf the Internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox,
            Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These files are
            called cookies.</p>
          <p>One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. To
            be more precise, they are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other areas of application. HTTP
            cookies are small files that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically
            stored in the cookie folder, the “brain” so to speak. your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value.
            When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>
          <p>Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal site settings. When you visit our
            site again, your browser sends the “user-related” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our
            website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its
            own file, in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>
          <p>The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as: B. Chrome and the web
            server. The web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server, which the browser
            uses again as soon as another page is requested.</p>
          <p>
            <img role="img" src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/http-cookie-interaction.svg"
              alt="HTTP cookie interaction between browser and web server" width="100%" />
          </p>
          <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our
            site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be
            evaluated individually because each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies
            from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or
            other “malicious” things. Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>
          <p>For example, cookie data may look like this:</p>
          <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Name:</strong> _ga<br />
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152312701248-9<br />

            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years
          </p>
          <p>A browser should be able to support these minimum sizes:</p>
          <ul class="adsimple-312701248">
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>

            <li class="adsimple-312701248">At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What types of cookies are there?</h3>
          <p>The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and is clarified in the
            following sections of the data protection declaration. At this point we would like to briefly discuss the
            different types of HTTP cookies.</p>
          <p>There are 4 types of cookies:</p>
          <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Essential cookies<br/>
            </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. For example, these cookies
            are needed when a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues surfing on other pages and only
            later checks out. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if the user closes their browser
            window.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Purpose cookies<br/>
            </strong>These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error
            messages. These cookies are also used to measure the loading time and behavior of the website on different
            browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Targeting cookies<br/>
            </strong>These cookies ensure better user experience. For example, entered locations, font sizes or form
            data are saved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-312701248">Advertising cookies<br/>
            </strong>These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They serve to provide the user with individually
            tailored advertising. This can be very practical, but also very annoying.
          </p>
          <p>When you first visit a website, you will usually be asked which of these types of cookies you would like to
            allow. And of course this decision is also saved in a cookie.</p>
          <p>If you would like to know more about cookies and are not afraid of technical documentation, we recommend <a
              class="adsimple-312701248"
              href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265</a>, the
            Request for Comments of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called &#8220;HTTP State Management
            Mechanism&#8221;.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Purpose of processing via cookies</h3>
          <p>The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find more details about this below or from
            the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What data is processed?</h3>
          <p>Cookies are little helpers for many different tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generalize which
            data is stored in cookies, but we will inform you about the data processed or stored in the following data
            protection declaration.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Storage period for cookies</h3>
          <p>The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are
            deleted after less than an hour, others can remain on a computer for several years.</p>
          <p>You also have an influence on the storage period. You can delete all cookies manually at any time via your
            browser (see also “Right to object” below). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent will be deleted
            at the latest after you revoke your consent, although the legality of storage remains unaffected until then.
          </p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Right to object &#8211; how can I delete cookies?</h3>
          <p>You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the
            cookies come from, you always have the option of deleting cookies, deactivating them or only partially
            allowing them. For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.</p>
          <p>If you would like to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, if you want to change or
            delete cookie settings, you can do this in your browser settings:</p>

          <p>If you generally do not want cookies, you can set your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie
            is to be set. This means you can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. The
            procedure varies depending on the browser. The best thing to do is to search for the instructions in Google
            using the search term “Delete cookies Chrome” or “Deactivate cookies Chrome” in the case of a Chrome
            browser.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Legal basis</h3>
          <p>The so-called “cookie guidelines” have existed since 2009. This states that the storage of cookies requires
            your consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). However, there are still very different reactions to these guidelines
            within the EU countries. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 Paragraph 3 of
            the Telecommunications Act (TKG). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not been implemented as national
            law. Instead, this directive was largely implemented in Section 15 Paragraph 3 of the Telemedia Act (TMG).
          </p>
          <p>For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are <strong
              class="adsimple-312701248">legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR), which in most
            cases are of an economic nature are. We want to provide visitors to the website with a pleasant user
            experience and certain cookies are often absolutely necessary for this.</p>
          <p>If non-essential cookies are used, this will only happen with your consent. RThe legal basis in this
            respect is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a GDPR.</p>
          <p>In the following sections you will be informed in more detail about the use of cookies, if the software
            used uses cookies.</p>

          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What is customer data?</h3>
          <p>So that we can offer our service and our contractual services, we also process data from our customers and
            business partners. This data always includes personal data. Customer data refers to all information that is
            processed on the basis of a contractual or pre-contractual collaboration in order to be able to provide the
            services offered. Customer data is all collected information that we collect and process about our
            customers.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Why do we process customer data?</h3>
          <p>There are many reasons why we collect and process customer data. The most important one is that we simply
            need various data to provide our services. Sometimes your email address is enough, but if you purchase a
            product or service, we also need data such as name, address, bank details or contract details. We also use
            the data for marketing and sales optimization so that we can improve our overall service for our customers.
            Another important point is our customer service, which is always very important to us. We want you to be
            able to come to us at any time with questions about our offers and for this we need at least your email
            address.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What data is processed?</h3>
          <p>Exactly which data is stored can only be shown at this point based on categories. This always depends on
            which services you receive from us. In some cases, you simply give us your email address so that we can, for
            example, contact you or answer your questions. In other cases, you purchase a product or service from us and
            for this we need significantly more information, such as your contact details, payment details and contract
            details.</p>
          <p>Here is a list of possible data that we receive and process from you:</p>
          <ul class="adsimple-312701248">
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Name</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Contact address</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Email address</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Phone number</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Date of birth</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Payment data (invoices, bank details, payment history, etc.)</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Contract data (term, content)</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Usage data (websites visited, access data, etc.)</li>
            <li class="adsimple-312701248">Metadata (IP address, device information)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">How long is the data stored?</h3>
          <p>As soon as we no longer need the customer data to fulfill our contractual obligations and our purposes and
            the data is no longer necessary for possible warranty and liability obligations, we delete the corresponding
            customer data. This is the case, for example, when a business contract ends. After that, the limitation
            period is usually 3 years, although longer periods are possible in individual cases. Of course, we also
            adhere to the legal retention requirements. Your customer data will definitely not be passed on to third
            parties unless you have explicitly given your consent.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Legal basis</h3>
          <p>The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 Para. 1
            lit. b GDPR (contract or pre-contractual measures), Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests) and in
            special cases (e.g. medical services) Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a. GDPRO (Special Category Processing).</p>
          <p>In the event of protecting vital interests, data processing takes place in accordance with Article 9
            Paragraph 2 Letter c. GDPR. For the purposes of health care, occupational medicine, medical diagnostics,
            care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the administration of systems and services in the
            health or social sector, personal data is processed in accordance with Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. H. GDPR. If you
            voluntarily provide data in the special categories, the processing will take place on the basis of Article 9
            Paragraph 2 Letter a. GDPR.</p>

          <p>
            <span class="adsimple-312701248" style="font-weight: 400">When you register, we collect certain data from
              you and enable you to later easily log in online and use your account with us. An account with us has the
              advantage that you don't have to re-enter everything every time. Saves time, effort and ultimately
              prevents errors in the delivery of our services.</span>

          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Why do we process personal data?</h3>

              the data every time, wait for us to approve it and enter everything again. We and many, many customers

              approaching us pre-contractually to conclude a usage agreement for our platform (even if a payment
              obligation does not automatically arise). You invest time to enter data and register and we offer you our
              services after logging into our system and viewing your customer account. We also fulfill our contractual
              obligations. Finally, we need to keep registered users informed of important changes via email. This means
              that Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR (implementation of pre-contractual measures, fulfillment of a contract)
              applies.

          <p>If necessary, we will also obtain your consent, e.g. if you voluntarily provide more data than is
            absolutely necessary or if we are allowed to send you advertising. Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent)

          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What is web design?</h3>
          <p>We use various tools on our website that serve our web design. Web design is not, as is often assumed, just
            about making our website look pretty, but also about functionality and performance. But of course the right
            look of a website is also one of the major goals of professional web design. Web design is a sub-area of
            media design and deals with the visual as well as the structural and functional design of a website. The aim
            is to use web design to improve your experience on our website. In web design jargon, this is referred to as
            user experience (UX) and usability. User experience refers to all the impressions and experiences that
            website visitors experience on a website. A sub-point of the user experience is usability. This is about the
            user-friendliness of a website. The main emphasis here is on ensuring that content, subpages or products are
            clearly structured and that you can find what you are looking for easily and quickly. In order to offer you
            the best possible experience on our website, we also use so-called third-party web design tools. In this
            data protection declaration, the “web design” category includes all services that improve the design of our
            website. These can be, for example, fonts, various plugins or other integrated web design functions.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Why do we use web design tools?</h3>
          <p>How you absorb information on a website depends very much on the structure, functionality and visual
            perception of the website. Therefore, good and professional web design became more and more important for
            us. We are constantly working on improving our website and see this as an extended service for you as a
            website visitor. Furthermore, a beautiful and functioning website also has economic advantages for us. After
            all, you will only visit us and take advantage of our offers if you feel completely comfortable.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What data are stored by web design tools?</h3>
          <p>When you visit our website, web design elements may be integrated into our pages, which can also process
            data. Exactly what data is involved, of course, depends heavily on the tools used. Below you can see exactly
            which tools we use for our website. We recommend that you read the respective data protection declaration of
            the tools used for more information about data processing. You will usually find out what data is being
            processed, whether cookies are being used and how long the data is being kept. Fonts such as Google Fonts
            also automatically transmit information such as language settings, IP address, browser version, browser
            screen resolution and browser name to the Google servers.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Duration of data processing</h3>
          <p>How long data is processed is very individual and depends on the web design elements used. For example, if
            cookies are used, the retention period can last as little as a minute or as long as a few years. Please be
            smart about this. On the one hand, we recommend our general text section on cookies and the data protection
            declarations of the tools used. There you can usually find out exactly which cookies are used and what
            information is stored in them. For example, Google Font files are stored for one year. This is intended to
            improve the loading time of a website. In principle, data is only retained for as long as is necessary to
            provide the service. AtDue to legal requirements, data can also be stored for longer periods.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Right to object</h3>
          <p>You also have the right and the opportunity to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party
            providers at any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. You
            can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, deactivating or deleting cookies in your
            browser. However, there is also data among web design elements (mostly fonts) that cannot be deleted so
            easily. This is the case when data is automatically collected directly when a page is accessed and
            transmitted to a third-party provider (such as Google). Then please contact the support of the relevant
            provider. In the case of Google, you can reach support at <a class="adsimple-312701248"
              href="https://support.google.com/?hl=de">https://support.google.com/?hl= en</a>.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Legal basis</h3>
          <p>If you have consented to the use of web design tools, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing
            is this consent. According to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), this consent represents the legal basis
            for the processing of personal data, as may occur when it is collected by web design tools. We also have a
            legitimate interest in web design to improve our website. After all, only then can we provide you with a
            beautiful and professional website. The corresponding legal basis for this is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f
            GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we only use web design tools if you have given your consent. We
            definitely want to emphasize this again here.</p>
          <p>You can get information about special web design tools &#8211; if available &#8211; in the following

          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
          <p>We use Google Fonts on our website. These are the &#8220;Google Fonts&#8221; of Google Inc. For the
            European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for
            all Google services.</p>
          <p>You do not need to register or provide a password to use Google fonts. Furthermore, no cookies are stored
            in your browser. The files (CSS, fonts/fonts) are requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and
            fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, requests for CSS and fonts are completely separate from all other
            Google services. If you have a Google Account, you do not need to worry that your Google Account information
            will be transmitted to Google while using Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style
            Sheets) and the fonts used and stores this data securely. We will take a closer look at what data storage
            looks like.</p>
          <p>Google Fonts (formerly Google Web Fonts) is a directory with over 800 fonts that <a
              class="adsimple-312701248" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC?tid=312701248">Google</a> make
            available to your users for free.</p>
          <p>Many of these fonts are released under the SIL Open Font License, while others are released under the
            Apache License. Both are free software licenses.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3>
          <p>With Google Fonts we can use fonts on our own website and don't have to upload them to our own server.
            Google Fonts is an important component in keeping the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are
            automatically optimized for the web and this saves data volume and is a big advantage, especially for use on
            mobile devices. When you visit our site, the low file size ensures a fast loading time. Furthermore, Google
            Fonts are secure web fonts. Different image synthshese systems (rendering) in different browsers, operating
            systems and mobile devices can lead to errors. Such errors can visually distort some texts or entire
            websites. Thanks to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN), there are no cross-platform issues with Google
            Fonts. Google Fonts supports all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) and
            works reliably on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad,
            iPod). We use Google Fonts so that we can present our entire online service as beautifully and consistently
            as possible.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What data does Google store?</h3>
          <p>When you visit our website, the fonts are downloaded via a Google server. Through this external call, data
            is transmitted to the Google servers. This is how Google also recognizes that you or your IP address visits
            our website. The Google Fonts API is designed to reduce the use, storage, and collection of end-user data to
            what is necessary for proper font delivery. By the way, API stands for “Application Programming Interface”
            and serves, among other things, as a data transmitter in the software sector.</p>
          <p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests securely on Google and is therefore protected. By collecting
            usage figures, Google can determine how well the individual fonts are received. Google publishes the results
            on internal analysis sites, such as Google Analytics. Google also uses data from its own web crawler to
            determine which websites use Google fonts. This data is published in the Google Fonts BigQuery database.
            Entrepreneurs and developers use the Google web service BigQuery to examine and move large amounts of data.
          </p>
          <p>However, it should also be remembered that every Google Font request also automatically transmits
            information such as language settings, IP address, browser version, browser screen resolution and browser
            name to the Google servers. Whether this data is also stored cannot be clearly determined or is not clearly
            communicated by Google.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
          <p>Google stores requests for CSS assets for one day on its servers, which are mainly located outside the EU.
            This allows us to use the fonts using a Google stylesheet. A style sheet is a format template that you can
            use to quickly and easily change the design or font of a website, for example.</p>
          <p>The font files are stored by Google for one year. Google's goal is to fundamentally improve the loading
            time of websites. When millions of websites reference the same fonts, they are cached after the first visit
            and immediately appear on all other websites visited later. Sometimes Google updates font files to reduce
            file size, increase language coverage, and improve design.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
          <p>The data that Google stores for a day or a year cannot simply be deleted. The data is automatically
            transmitted to Google when the page is accessed. In order to delete this data early, you must contact Google
            Support at <a class="adsimple-312701248" href="https://support.google.com/?hl=de&amp;tid=312701248">https:/
              /support.google.com/?hl=de&amp;tid=312701248</a>. In this case, you can only prevent data storage if you
            do not visit our site.</p>
          <p>Unlike other web fonts, Google allows us unlimited access to all fonts. So we have unlimited access to a
            sea of fonts and get the best for our website. You can find out more about Google Fonts and other questions
            at https://developers.google.com /fonts/faq?tid=312701248</a>. Although Google addresses data
            protection-related matters there, it does not contain any really detailed information about data storage. It
            is relatively difficult to get really precise information about stored data from Google.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">Legal basis</h3>
          <p>If you have consented to the use of Google Fonts, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is
            this consent. This consent represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data as recorded by
            Google fonts can occur.</p>
          <p>We also have a legitimate interest in using Google Font to optimize our online service. The corresponding
            legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests).
              However, we only use Google Font if you have given your consent.</p>
          <p>Google also processes your data in the USA, among other places. Google is an active participant in the
            EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data from EU
            citizens to the USA. You can find more information about this at <a class="adsimple-312701248"

          </p>
          <p>In addition, Google uses so-called standard contractual clauses (= Art. 46 Paragraphs 2 and 3 GDPR).
            Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure
            that your data complies with European data protection standards even if it is transferred to third countries
            (such as the USA) and stored there. Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Standard Contractual
            Clauses, Google undertakes to comply with the European level of data protection when processing your
            relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an
            implementing decision of the EU Commission. You can find the resolution and the corresponding standard
            contractual clauses here: <a class="adsimple-312701248"

          <h2 id="google-fonts-local-data protection declaration" class="adsimple-312701248">Google Fonts Local data
            protection declaration</h2>
          <p>On our website we use Google Fonts from Google Inc. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House,
            Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for Europe. We have the Google fonts locally, i.e. on our
            web server &#8211; not on Google's servers &#8211; integrated. This means there is no connection to Google
            servers and therefore no data transfer or storage.</p>
          <h3 class="adsimple-312701248">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
          <p>Google Fonts used to be called Google Web Fonts. This is an interactive directory with over 800 fonts that
            <a class="adsimple-312701248" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC?tid=312701248">Google</a>
            provided free of charge. With Google Fonts you could use fonts without uploading them to your own server.
            However, in order to prevent any information transfer to Google servers, we have downloaded the fonts to our
            server. In this way, we act in accordance with data protection regulations and do not send any data to
            Google Fonts.</p>
          <h2 id="explanation of terms used" class="adsimple-312701248">Explanation of terms used</h2>
          <p>We always strive to make our data protection declaration as clear and understandable as possible. However,
            this is not always easy, especially when it comes to technical and legal issues. It often makes sense to use
            legal terms (such as personal data) or certain technical terms (such as cookies, IP address). But we don't
            want to use them without explanation. Below you will find an alphabetical list of important terms used that
            we may not have addressed sufficiently in the previous data protection declaration. If these terms were
            taken from the GDPR and they are definitions, we will also cite the GDPR texts here and add our own
            explanations if necessary.</p>
          <h2 id="final word" class="adsimple-312701248">Final word</h2>
          <p>Congratulations! If you are reading these lines, you have actually “fought” your way through our entire
            privacy policy or at least scrolled this far. As you can see from the scope of ourSee privacy policy, we
            take the protection of your personal data anything but lightly.<br />
            It is important to us to inform you to the best of our knowledge and belief about the processing of personal
            data. We not only want to tell you which data is processed, but also explain the reasons for using various
            software programs. As a rule, data protection declarations sound very technical and legal. Since most of you
            are not web developers or lawyers, we wanted to take a different linguistic approach and explain the matter
            in simple and clear language. Of course, this is not always possible due to the subject matter. Therefore,
            the most important terms are explained in more detail at the end of the data protection declaration.<br />
            If you have any questions about data protection on our website, please do not hesitate to contact us or the
            responsible body. We wish you a nice time and hope to welcome you back to our website soon.</p>
